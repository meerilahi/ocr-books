and business of the government is running and rights and duties of the citizens are determined. In absence of the constitution, system of the state cannot run for much time. Therefore, after the establishment of Pakistan the British Government of India Act 1935 and Act of 1947 with certain amendments was adopted in the country as an interim constitution and making of new constitution was entrusted to the constituent assembly. First session of the constituent assembly of Pakistan was held in Karachi on $11^{\text {th }}$ August 1947, under the presidentship of Jugindher Nath Mandal.

This constituent assembly consisted of the members elected in 1946 election. This assembly elected Quaid-e-Azam as its president unanimously. According to the Independence Act 1947, the constituent assembly had two responsibilities.

1. Setting up a constitution for the country
2. Legislation as a federal legislature

Quaid-e-Azam gave an outline for constitution making in his speech on $11^{\text {th }}$ August 1947. He in his address told to avoid the curse of influence, nepotism, corruption, adulteration, hoarding and profiteering and strongly opposed, racial, lingual, regional, religious hatred and prejudice. He told that all the citizens will have the equal political rights but unluckily Quaid-e-Azam died before making constitution for the country and the constitution making process became slow.

# 5. REFUGEES PROBLEM 

The second great problem to the new government and people of Pakistan was the rehabilitation of the refugees. According to an estimate of the Government of Pakistan 6.5 million refugees migrated to Pakistan as a result of exchange of population out of which 5.2 million came from eastern Punjab and her states, likewise 0.36 million came from Delhi and the remaining from Northern India and other parts. About 0.5 million Muslims were either assassinated on the way or kidnapped. While on other side 5.5 million Sikhs and Hindus migrated from Pakistan.
268000 Non-Muslims migrated from NWFP to India while only 20000 refugees migrated from India rehabilitated in NWFP. Therefore, the population of Pakistan increased by 1000000 persons with the arrival of refugees. The permanent rehabilitation of
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
refugees was not an easy job for Pakistan. Provision of food, residence, medical aid and job etc. all were necessary to these people.

The government in spite of her limited resources, housed the refugees in temporary camps and arrangements were made to the best for their boarding and lodging. Apart from these
![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
(Refugees coming to Pakistan)
problems some social problems were also created with the arrival of refugees.

# 6. GEOGRAPHIC AND DEFENSE PROBLEMS 

Geographically, Pakistan has great importance because it is located in such part of the world where it is connected with China and India on one side and on the other side with Afghanistan and Iran. In addition Pakistan is located on the junction of central Asia and south Asia thus its importance increases further.

Pakistan was worried for the defense of her boundaries from the very first day. Because there was not only the distance of 1600 km between east and west Pakistan but there was India between the two parts. Pakistan was not in good relations with India due to different causes. Besides, Pakistan was
not strong economically and militarily. Modern weapons airplanes and marine planes and other war equipment with Pakistan were equal to none and the new government was in constant struggle to strengthen the country defense as possible.

# 7. ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 

The new government of Pakistan not only needed to complete the political structure but also to provide economic stability to the people. The areas given to Pakistan in partition were backward in agriculture except some districts.

There was lack of industries in these areas. Political crises and arrival of the refugees further disturbed the situation. But government with great responsibility controlled the critical economic conditions and gave the country stability.

## ROLE OF QUAID-E-AZAM AND LIAQUAT ALI KHAN IN THE STABILITY OF THE COUNTRY

The first Governor General of Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam and Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan not only made constitutional efforts in the freedom movement and for the establishment of Pakistan but also made the country stable by working hard day and night. But serving the country for one year and 25 days the Father of the Nation, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, died on $11^{\text {th }}$ September 1948. During the little period of one year Quaid-e-Azam joint with Liaquat Ali Khan taken such steps, through which many problems of the Government of Pakistan were overcome.

Some guiding principles highlighted by Quaid-e-Azam are the following;-

1. For the rehabilitation of refugees he not only persuaded-the people to be patient but also took practical steps for their settlement. e.g. established refugees relief fund.
2. Keeping in view the national integrity, the government allocated a large portion of country's budget to defense. He tried to solve the disputes with India and Afghanistan peacefully.
3. Quaid-e-Azam in his address on $15^{\text {th }}$ June 1948 advised the people to avoid the provincial and racial prejudice. He instructed the civil servants to perform duties as servant of the people, adopt such attitude that the people may feel that you are not the rulers but servant of the nation.
4. To make strong the status of Pakistan, Quaid-e-Azam together with Liaquat Ali Khan determined some guiding principles which aimed the establishment of a society based on equality and social justice.
5. Quaid-e-Azam played an important role in attracting younger generation towards education. He tried to make the youth realize that younger generation is the future of the nation. He insisted upon the young people to give attention only and only to education and to avoid the agitational politics and work for the prosperity and existence of the country.

As mentioned earlier that Pakistan came into existence on the world Map on $14^{\text {th }}$ August 1947. To identify and introduce Pakistan, Quaid-e-Azam and Liaquat Ali Khan made Pakistan a member of United Nations organization and within a few months established bilateral relations with many countries. The important point regarding foreign policy of the new country was that there will be friendly relations on equality basis with the countries in general and with neighbors and Muslim countries in special.

# ACCESSION OF THE STATES 

Before partition there were 560 princely states in British India but according to the June 1947 plan besides other things, these states have been given the option of whether they want to remain independent or join India or Pakistan. Under this principle Bahawalpur, Makran, Qallat, and States of NWFP (KP) acceded to Pakistan. In addition, the states of Junagarh and Manawader decided accession to Pakistan. But Indian Government in November, 1948 entered her forces in these states and took it over by force. The ruler was compelled to take refuge in Karachi. The Indian Government gave reason for that the people of these states wanted to join India.

Hyderabad was a prosperous and densely populated state of India. Its population was consisted of Hindu majority but its ruler, who held the title of Nizam, was a Muslim. The Nizam was inclined to make Hyderabad an independent state. He requested the viceroy to give the state the status of a Dominion (an independent state, and the British Crown to appoint her Governor General) but he did not agree. India blockaded the State, entered its troops in Hyderabad and it was annexed to India forcibly.

In addition, the important state was that of Jammu and Kashmir, her population was 4.00 million according to the Census of 1941 and her 1000 km long boarder is connected with Pakistan. Besides, all the rivers of Kashmir flow into Pakistan and many of the routes of the state are connected with Pakistan. Though under the Indian partition plan of $3^{\text {rd }}$ June 1947, these states were given the option that they can accede to India or Pakistan or can remain independent also. But along with these options they will be abide by two things.

1. Geographical location may not be ignored.
2. Decision of accession should be according to the will of the people.

Looking towards British India, the waves of Independence came over in
Kashmir also and a series of meetings and processions were started against Maharaja. At that time people of Kashmir had been divided into two political parties one all Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference under the leadership of Sardar Ibrahim and Chaudri Ghulam Abbas and the other, all Jammu and Kashmir National Conference under the leadership of Sheikh Abdullah were struggling politically.

Maharaja Hari Singh signed a Standstill Agreement with Pakistan but India refused such an agreement and freedom movement was started in Kashmir which Maharaja failed to crush and sought help from India. The British Governor General of India Lord Mountbatten on the request of Maharaja sent Army to Srinagar but this was also cleared that the future of the state will be decided by the people of the state. On $22^{\text {nd }}$ October 1947, people from tribal areas adjacent to frontier province reached Kashmir to help the Kashmiris. On First November Quaid-e-Azam held talks with Mountbatten but failed. Meanwhile the Indian Government took military possession of the State, in order to maintain the possession; the Indian Government herself brought the issue to Security Council. The Security Council passed two resolutions on $12^{\text {th }}$ August 1948 and on $5^{\text {th }}$ January 1949, which were accepted by both Pakistan and Indian Governments. Following are the main points of those resolutions.
a. War may be stopped immediately and a cease fire line may be drawn between held Kashmir and Azad Kashmir under the supervision of a United Nations Commission.
b. Both the governments may withdraw their troops from Kashmir.
c. A referendum may be managed under the supervision of the United Nations.
According to the United Nations Resolutions, there was a cease-fire but the issue of Kashmir remained not only a tension between Pakistan and India but also the cause of several wars. There had been several wars between the two countries. It is necessary to solve the problem of Kashmir through
dialogue keeping in view the wishes of Kashimri people for the peace and prosperity in the region.

# ACCESSION OF TRIBAL AREAS 

After the $3^{\text {rd }}$ June, plan the tribal areas of NWFP (KP) declared accession with Pakistan in their traditional jirgas, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah on the first opportunity, visited different areas of Pakistan to create patriotism among the people and can acquire their services for the new government. In this connection he came to Peshawar also. In Peshawar during his address to tribal Jirga, he ordered the withdrawal of forces from tribal areas, to maintain solidarity with Pakistan among the tribal people and state of confidence on each other, Quaid-e-Azam ordered to withdraw forces especially from North and South Waziristan. Due to the steps taken by Quaid-e-Azam, the tribal people felt pleasure for the first time and they also felt that after the departure of British there is clear difference between the policies and thinking of the government of Pakistan and that the government gave them hands of love and brotherhood to make them her own. In addition, Quaid-e-Azam formed the Ministry of State and Frontier Regions to give attention to the welfare of the people.

## OBJECTIVES RESOLUTION (1949)

This resolution was passed by the then Prime Minister Liaqat Ali Khan from the constituent assembly on $12^{\text {th }}$ March 1949. Objectives Resolution is one of the most important document in constitution making history of Pakistan. Islam has been declared as the ideological base for the Constitution of Pakistan. Because of the facts that when the Muslims of Subcontinent were struggling for the freedom, they had demanded such a state where they could lead their lives according to the golden principles of Islam. Where they can protect their cultural heritage. Therefore, after the creation of Pakistan, it was desirable that we should declare Islam as the basis of our state policies.
# MAIN POINTS OF OBJECTIVES RESOLUTION 

1. Objectives Resolution states that sovereignty all over the universe belongs to Almighty Allah. The powers which Almighty Allah has bestowed on the people of Pakistan are being exercised within the limits prescribed by Him is a sacred trust.
2. Power of the state shall be exercised through the elected representatives of the people.
3. Islamic Principles of democracy, freedom, tolerance and social justice will be observed.
4. The Muslims of Pakistan will be enabled to order their lives according to the teachings of Islam.

6. All fundamental human rights will be guaranteed.
7. Independence of judiciary shall be fully secured.
8. Federal system of government shall be established in the country in which provinces shall be give autonomy with such limitations as may be prescribed.

## IMPORTANCE OF OBJECTIVES RESOLUTION

After the creation of Pakistan the approval of Objectives Resolution has the status of a significant step in the history of the country. Its importance is due to the fact that it remains the basis of all the successives constitutions framed later on. The Objectives Resolution remained a part of all the constitutions as a preamble. This was made the basic part of Pakistan constitution of 1973 by amendment in 1985.

## CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT

After the approval of Objectives Resolution, the next process was to make a constitution on the
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
(Khwaja Nazing-ud-Din)
basis of these objectives. In order to accelerate the process of constitution making, different committees were formed. One of the committees was named as Basic Principles Committee. This committee submitted recommendations one after another but were rejected.

Later on Governor General Ghulam Muhammad appointed Muhammad Ali Bogra, as new Prime Minister in place of Khawaja Nazimuddin. The new Prime Minister gave a new formula, which is called a Muhammad Ali Bogra formula. This was
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
(Muhammad Ali Bogra)
acceptable to both east and west Pakistan. But Governor General Ghulam Muhammad dissolved the assembly to prolong his powers.

In June 1955 the second constituent assembly came into being. The decision made by this assembly was the formation of one unit. The four provinces of western part were amalgamated into one province called the West Pakistan. Accordingly the Eastern Bengal was named East Pakistan.

# CONSTITUTION OF 1956 

The constituent assembly accelerated the process of constitution making under the guidance of new Prime Minister Chaudhri Muhammad Ali. At last the first constitution of the country was enforced on $23^{\text {rd }}$ March 1956. It has 234 articles.

## SALIENT FEATURES OF THE CONSTITUTION OF 1956

Iskandar Mirza who dethroned Guhlam Muhammad and a Governor General on $16^{\text {th }}$ October 1955, was actually representing two strong institutions of Pakistan i.e. army and bureaucracy. With the enforcement of new constitution he became president but he removed four Prime Ministers one by one in two years. With the removal of $4^{\text {th }}$ Prime Minister Feroz Khan Noon, Iskander Mirza imposed martial law in the country and constitution of 1956 was abrogated.

# GENERAL AYUB KHAN AND MARTIAL LAW OF 1958 

The first President of Pakistan Iskander Mirza only for his personal terest abrogated the constitution of 1956. He promulgated martial law in the country on $7^{\text {th }}$ October 1958 and the army Chief General Ayub Khan was appointed as chief martial law administrator. But only 20 days later General Ayub Khan forced Iskander Mirza to resign the office of president and was exiled. He himself assumed the power and political system was abolished on 27th October 1958, accordingly.

## CAUSES OF PROMULGATION OF MARTIAL LAW IN PAKISTAN

Martial law was promulgated in Pakistan on $7^{\text {th }}$ October 1958 due to the following causes.

## 1. WORST ECONOMIC CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY

Political stability is necessary for economic stability of the country which was becoming bad in the country day by day. 'Pakistan is an agricultural country' was the high claim of government but even food items were also imported which on the one side was very costly and on the other side there were drawbacks in the process of distribution and worries were found in the people due to this. Besides smuggling, black marketing and
hoarding were also at the peak. Smuggling in the country had adopted the shape of a business while smugglers were supported by effective people. Karachi was the then capital of Pakistan where every kind of corruption was at the peak.

# 2. POLITICAL DISORDER 

Right from the time when Pakistan came into being, people with political leaders made efforts to move the 'country towards development. By 1957 political conditions of the country were so deteriorated and the political differences were so much that different ministries of the government were not functioning satisfactorily. Prime Ministers in the country were changing every day and the rulers were postponing election in the country for their own interest. Muslim League, the founding party of Pakistan' faced defeat in the elections of 1954 in East Pakistan. Instead of people, the Pakistan Republican Party formed with the blessing of Iskander Mirza was active in struggle for power. There was nominal parliamentary system in the country but the prime minister had no status. Politicians were exploiting the poor people by verbal claims of Islam and democracy. This state of affairs was creating the condition of tension in both parts east and west Pakistan. And at last the result of such political mismanagement came in the shape of martial law.

## 3. WORST TRADE CONDITIONS

Like political and economic conditions, trade condition was also disappointing. Profiteering and adulteration in food stuff had been common. Demand for our goods and raw materials in the world market was near to finish and the ruling class did not take any steps for its improvement. Pakistani currency was devalued and for the completion of all developmental projects, Pakistan remained dependant on western countries. In addition the pace of industrial development was very slow. Strikes, lockouts and industrial conflicts were the daily routine matters. As a result of which the people became disgusted with the rulers.
# 4. SOCIAL DEFECTS 

The effect of political and economic mismanagement in the country was, a sense of alienation was growing in the society. Provincial prejudice was enhancing. Tension were rising in both parts of the country. Due to which people wanted a tangible change that lead to democracy, equality, and economic and social prosperity of the people.

## i. MISCELLANEOUS PROBLEMS

Along with the weaknesses in political institutions in the country, the sense of responsibility was missing in the politician's role and bureaucracy. They preferred their own interests on the national and public interests. Besides, the role of the important pillar of the government i.e. judiciary was also not commendable. In addition the pending problems of the country for example, the rehabilitation of refugees, canal water dispute and the Kashmir issue remained unsolved and no one tried for their solution. In these circumstances, Iskander Mirza abrogated the constitution and promulgated martial law in the country which dealt a severe blow to the democratic process.

## REFORMS OF THE AYUB KHAN REGIME

Ayub Khan while taking over the charge of government announced reforms for the development and prosperity of the country. Main reforms were the following.

1. Agricultural Reforms
2. Economic Reforms

## 1. AGRICULTURAL REFORMS

Since Pakistan is basically an agricultural country. Therefore, the new government formed a commission on $31^{\text {st }}$ October 1958 which gave a report to the government on the solution of agricultural problems and its improvement in January 1959. The government immediately implemented
the following reforms.

1. Government abolished all the manors (Jagirs).
2. Limit of possession for any person was determined as 500 acres canal irrigated and 1000 acres raw irrigated land. In addition, the farmer can keep with him 150 acres for gardens.
3. Rights of the peasants were safeguarded. Forced labour from the tillers was strongly prohibited.
4. The area of land with the farmer beyond limit was taken into custody by the government and they were given in return the government bonds.
5. In land consolidation, the revolutionary steps were also taken. Small pieces of land were consolidated and made able for the modern cultivation.

Though there were some defects in the land reforms of government but for the time being the agricultural reforms brought improvement in the economy. The peasants and the poor class rights were admitted. Farmers and peasants were given tube wells and tractors on easy loans. These steps were named by the Ayub Khan government as Green Revolution.

# 2. ECONOMIC REFORMS 

Ayub Khan took such initiatives for the economic development in Pakistan that the decade of 1960 was called the decade of development. For the setup of new industries, the government adopted a comprehensive plan. Not only the dead industries were redeveloped, but new industries were installed also. During this period the economic development can be estimated from the second five year developmental plan. As a result of reforms of Ayub Khan the development in the country is as.

1. National income increased by 30 percent.
2. Exports increased by 7 percent annually.
3. Industrial sector progressed by more than 40 percent.
4. In the agriculture sector development was more than 15 percent. During that period the indigenous industries were insisted to use more local raw materials, so that foreign exchange could be saved.

# PAKISTAN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION 

Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (P.I.D.C) was established in 1949. In order to make it more active, it was divided into two parts so that the new situation can be further improved. During that time work was started on big dams for example, Mangla Dam and Turbela Dam etc. Government took many initiatives to develop the cottage industries so that, in addition to the urban areas the rural areas may not left behind in development race.

## SYSTEM OF BASIC DEMOCRACIES (POLITICAL REFORMS)

General Muhammad Ayub Khan thought that parliamentary system of democracy remained unsuccessful to solve the problems of the people of Pakistan. In his opinion, parliamentary system of democracy was not suitable for the countries like Pakistan because on one side there was lack of political awareness and on the other side there was poverty, ignorance and illiteracy.

Ayub Khan enforced the Basic Democracies System in October, 1959 to introduce a new Political System in the Country. This was such a system of Local Government which started from downward and went upward. It had four stages i.e. Union Council, Thana/Tehsil Council, District Council, Divisional and provincial Council.

The Main Aims of this System were the following:-

1. To provide opportunities for development at local or basic level.
2. To provide training to the public representatives by the bureaucracy.
3. To make agree all public representatives and relevant offices to work together.
According to this system, on the lower level, in urban or rural areas where population consists of 1000 -people, they can elect their representatives of a Union Council. Union Council was struggling for the development of area, development of agriculture and rule of law. Union Council used to receive local tax on certain goods. The activities and procedure of election was criticized due to the reason that all the works of Union Council were controlled by the Deputy Commissioner and all the representatives of the Union Council were indebted to those decisions. Benefit of this system was that, the public representatives were aware of their problems at the local level and opportunities were available for the solution of problems. The interesting thing was that the Basic Democracies members, who were 80000 in number later on increased to 120000 , were not only used at the basic level but in 1960, the Union Council representatives elected Ayub Khan as a President of Pakistan. And later on, under the constitution of 1962, all the B.D.Members adopted the status of an Electoral College and thus the BD Members used to elect President and members of National and Provincial Assemblies. This election procedure was greatly criticized because the members of National and Provincial Assemblies elected in this manner could not be called the actual public representatives as it was easy to put official pressure on 80000 -members. Government used the BD-members for the personal aims without any doubt. As a result, the BD-Scheme could not become a democratic system. Instead of political training of people at the lower level and social reform, this system became a cause of further tension. Educated and intellectuals considered this system as a source of keeping in power the ruling party i.e. Convention Muslim League or Ayub Khan. Therefore, the people disliked this system and hence with the decline of Ayub Khan, this system was abolished.

# MUSLIM FAMILY LAW ORDINANCE (SOCIAL REFORMS) 

One of the important initiatives and reforms during the Ayub Khan's regime was the Muslim Family Law Ordinance. It was enforced in the shape of an ordinance in 1961. Its main points are the following:-
1. Entry of Marriage was made compulsory in Union Council.
2. Willingness of the first wife was necessary for second marriage for any male.
3. Traditional method of divorce of three times together was abandoned in the law for divorce and it was given a legal shape.
4. Arbitration Councils were established at the Union Council level with the following functions:-
A- To make patch-up between wife and husband in case of divorce.
B- Man may be given permission of second marriage when consent of first wife is taken and he can support her.
C- To determine the responsibility of supporting the wife and children.
D- Females were provided more legal safety with this ordinance.
E- Imam and Khateeb were appointed as Registrar for entry of marriage in the Union Council.
F- First time family planning introduced for control of population.
Where this ordinance was welcomed, some people criticized it also.

# CONSTITUTION OF 1962 

President Ayub Khan formed a Constitutional Commission which was headed by Justice Shahab-ud-Din. This Commission kept in mind past and present of the country and submitted different constitutional recommendations to the government in 1961. But interesting is that majority of the recommendations of this commission were not acceptable to president Ayub Khan himself, therefore, he framed another constitutional committee. The framed constitution of that committee was imposed by Ayub Khan through an ordinance on $1^{\text {st }}$ March, 1962. In this way second constitution was enforced in the country after the interim period of three years and nine month.
# SALIENT FEATURES OF CONSTITUTION OF 1962 (CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS) 

Following are the salient features of 1962 Constitution.

1. The original constitution did not contain a list of fundamental rights but later on a list of fundamental rights was included in the constitution.
2. Presidential system was introduced in the country under the constitution.
3. Election to the office of the president will be for five years term.
4. The constitution declared the country one federation consisted of the two provinces i.e. East and West Pakistan.
5. Both Urdu and Bengali were declared the national languages of Pakistan, while English was given the status of official language.
6. Independence and autonomy of judiciary was guaranteed. A unicameral legislature was provided i.e. National Assembly of Pakistan. Total members of assembly were 156, equally distributed among East and West Pakistan. Out of these 6 seats were specified for females.
7. Election to the office of the President as well as Members of National and Provincial Assemblies will be made by Electoral College of B.D. Members.

## ISLAMIC PROVISION OF 1962 CONSTITUTION

1. The head of state, president, must be Muslim.
2. It was mentioned in the constitution to enable the Muslim of Pakistan, individually and collectively to accord their lives according to the teachings of Quran Majeed and Sunnah.
3. It was mentioned in the constitution that no law may be legislated against Quran and Sunnah and all existing laws shall be brought in conformity with Quran and Sunnah.

7. It was promised in the constitution to make proper arrangement for Zakat, Auqaf and Mosque.
8. According to the constitution the friendly relation shall be established with Muslim states.

# CTIONS OF 1965 

With the imposition of constitution of 1962, different political parties of Pakistan started their activities. Old leaders of the Muslim League called the party convention. One of the important leader was Chaudhri Khaleeq-uzZaman. Convention elected Ayub Khan as president of Muslim League but this decision was not acceptable to all members of the Muslim League. In reaction Mian Mumtaz Daultana called meeting of Party Council in Dhaka and thus Muslims League was divided into two parts. One was called Convention* Muslim League and the other was Council Muslim League. In presidential election Ayub Khan had contested with Miss Fatima Jinnah the sister of Qauid-e-Azam. All the opposition parties were supporting Fatima Jinnah. Besides, Council Muslim League, Jummat-e-Islami, Awami League, National Awami Party etc were included in these parties. In this election governors of East and West Pakistan openly used BD-members, the government machinery in favour of Ayub Khan and against Fatima Jinnah. Due to all these illegal and immoral trickery, Fatima Jinnah lost the election against Ayub Khan and Ayub Khan was declared successful. These elections have not had a positive impact on the future of Pakistan.
# PAK-INDIA WAR, 1965 

The year of 1965 in the history of Pakistan has fame for struggle of democratic powers and Pak-India War. This year in April in the area of RunKatch, there was a border war between the forces of Pakistan and India. Pak; Army got vacated all those areas from Indian Army occupied by them. Indian Government blamed that Pakistani raiders are busy in secret activities in Kashmir and simultaneously started shelling from Artillery on the border of Pakistan and Kashmir near Gujrat. Pakistani forces launched the operation while crossing cease-fire. To decrease this pressure, India attacked the Pakistani borders in the area of Sialkot, Qasoor and Lahore at night on $6^{\text {th }}$ September, 1965. President Ayub Khan on $6^{\text {th }}$ September, 1965 while addressing the nation properly announced the war with India. PakIndia war spread over the different areas of West Pakistan i.e. Sindh, Punjab and Kashmir. In this war of 17days Army, Air and Naval forces of both the countries took part. For the cease fire, where former Soviet Union offered arbitration to both the countries, the United Nations played her role. At last, a proper cease fire was made on $23^{\text {rd }}$ September, 1965. On the arbitration of Soviet Union, an accord was signed between the then Prime Minister of India Lal Bahadur
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
(Pak -Indian War 1965)
Shahstri and President of Pakistan Ayub Khan, at Tashkent (a city of Uzbekistan). Tashkent Conference continued from $4^{\text {th }}$ January to $10^{\text {th }}$ January 1966. Tashkent accord consisted of 9-points. In those points besides other things, stress was given to solve the mutual disputes between both the countries through dialogue.

# MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRACY AND DECLINE OF AYUB KHAN 

The Pak-India war of 1965 weakened the country economically on one hand and on the other hand this sense was developed in the East Pakistan that during the war, no satisfactory arrangements were made by the central government for the defense of East Pakistan. Therefore, they started political movement for provincial autonomy under the leadership of Sheikh Mujeeb-ur-Rehman. In West Pakistan, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto formed his own political party with the name of Pakistan People's Party in 1967, which launched a movement and gained popularity against Ayub Khan. Meanwhile, the student's agitation spread in both the parts of country. In addition peasants, labourers, lawyers and government servants joined movement for democracy against the government. Ayub Khan also convened Round Table Conference for dialogue with political parties but this effort of the government also failed and at last Ayub Khan had to leave the office. He entrusted authority to the Army Chief General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan on $25^{\text {th }}$ March, 1969.

## ERA OF GENERAL YAHYA KHAN(1969-1971)

General Yahya Khan ruled the country from $25^{\text {th }}$ March,1969, to $20^{\text {th }}$ December, 1971. Martial law Government not only held talks with political parties but also abolished the one unit and reinstated the old provinces.

For the first time Balochistan, was given the status of a province and method of adult franchise was introduced in the country. In order to remove
worries, found in the people, Yahya Khan also made industrial and educational reforms. Inspite of all these things, he was facing a constitutional crisis. The constitution of 1962 was made by Ayub Khan but that had been annulled by the Government of Yahya Khan, under compulsion gave a formula called the Legal Frame Work Order on $29^{\text {th }}$ March, 1970. This constitutional draft was prepared by a committee. After hard work which was constituted for this purpose.

# Important points of the Legal frame work order were:- 

1. Islamic ideology will be safeguarded in the future constitution.
2. The Islamic Republic of Pakistan will be federal government which will consist of all parts of the country.
3. In the constitution safety will be given to fundamental rights, adult franchise and freedom of judiciary.
4. In the constitution maximum provincial autonomy will be given, however the centre will be strong.
5. It was decided that equal opportunities will be provided to all citizens of the country for taking part in national life. In a short period through legislation, economic inequalities will be finished from all parts of Pakistan.

According to L.F.O, there will be 313 seats of the National Assembly. Out of which 13 seats will be specified for females. In addition, female can take part in election on general seats too. Division of seats in National Assembly was:-
|  Province | General Seats | Specified Seats  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  East Pakistan | 162 | 7  |
|  Punjab | 82 | 3  |
|  Sindh | 27 | 1  |
|  NWFP (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) | 18 | 1  |
|  Balochistan | 4 | 1  |
|  Tribal Areas | 7 | 1  |

The procedure of election was also mentioned in the LFO that what type of people can take part in election. Further that new elected assembly will have to make constitution for the country within 120 days from the first session. In case of failure, the assembly will be dismissed automatically. The policy of state for new constitution was also given in the LFO which was impossible to ignore. President was also empowered to reject the constitution in violation of the determined principles of the LFO, otherwise, the assembly will be dismissed automatically. President had the authority to return constitution to assembly for review. These presidential decisions could not be challenged in courts.

# GENERAL ELECTIONS OF 1970

Elections of 1970 are one of the memorable works of the General Yahya Khan. General elections were held in December 1970. Polling for the National Assembly was held on 7 December and for Provincial Assembly on 17 December. For the first time 63 small and major parties in the country took part in elections on the basis of adult franchise. Among the major parties were Pakistan People's Party, Awami League, Muslim League, National Party, Jumat-e-Islami and Jamiat-e-Ulama Islam. They kept their program and
manifesto before the people, but as per result of elections, in East Pakistan Awami league won 167 seats out of 169 seats and in West Pakistan People's Party won 87 seats out of 138 . Pakistan People's Party failed to take any seat in East Pakistan and Awami League did not take any seat in West Pakistan. In West Pakistan, Pakistan People's Party got success in Punjab and Sindh, while in NWFP (K.P) and Balochistan, National Awami Party and Jamiat-e-Ulama Islam were succeeded.

Instead of transferring the power to the wining parties the military government started evasion. This not only brought mistrust but also created a state of tension among both major parties of the country. In East Pakistan, strong protest was started against the attitude of government.

The people of East Pakistan fully demanded that keeping in view the democratic norms, powers may be transferred to the party having majority. Military rulers got benefit of the mutual confrontation of the politicians and gave length to their rules. They not only deployed Army to crush the movement of Civil Disobedience in East Pakistan for the sake of the defense of the country but also arrested Sheikh Mujib-ur-Rehman, the president of Awami League.

Taking advantage of this political and constitutional crisis, India interfered militarily through different means in East Pakistan. The conditions in East Pakistan became worst. As a result, India by force separated East Pakistan, power in West Pakistan was entrusted to Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.

# CAUSES OF THE FALL OF EAST PAKISTAN 

Separation of East Pakistan was not only a great tragedy for Pakistan, but was a moment of sorrow for the Muslims all over the world. This tragic incident took place on 16 December 1971, when East Pakistan became Bangladesh. Following were the causes of this tragedy:
# 1. PROBLEM OF GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION 

Unfortunately both parts of Pakistan were at a distance of 1600 km and India was in between the two. This physical distance was creating problems in defence and transportation.

## 2. LANGUAGE ISSUE

After the establishment of Pakistan, only Urdu was adopted as national language but majority of the East Pakistanis loved their language and literature, used to speak Bengali. After independence when central government declared only Urdu as national language of Pakistan, the people in East Pakistan demonstrated and launched a movement in favour of Bengali. At last under compulsion, the central government declared both Urdu and Bengali as national languages but of no avail. The people of East Pakistan disliked the West Pakistanis and the issue of language reached the Bengali nationalism.

(East \& West Pakistan)
# 3. DEVIATION FROM DEMOCRATIC VALUES 

New constitution was prepared in a long period of 9 years in Pakistan due to which different pillars of the government opposed each other. Hardly a constitution was prepared in 1956, but the same was abolished after some time and a never ending military dictatorship was becoming strong in the country. Awami League, the wining party of 1970 elections was deprived of the power by one pretext or another. The result was the separation of East Pakistan.

## 4. ECONOMIC DISPARITY

Pakistan was not economically stable as a whole from the very first day of independence but especially the ratio of poverty in East Pakistan was very higher due to different causes. Bengalis were of the opinion that their economic backwardness will be finished with the establishment of Pakistan but their dreams remained incomplete. Besides, there was displeasure due to the undemocratic attitude of the politicians of West Pakistan. At last the six point formula of Sheikh Mujib-ur-Rehman became very popular among the people. Mujib-ur-Rehman told the people of East Pakistan that without provincial autonomy, the progress of East Pakistan is impossible. At last after the elections of 1970, when Yahya Khan did not transfer the power to Mujib-ur-Rehman, he substituted the demand of provincial autonomy for freedom. 5. MILITARY ACTION

Political restlessness and Armed struggle of Awami League in East Pakistan was termed as revolt by the government of Pakistan and took action in East Pakistan. Many innocent citizens along with the Armed persons were killed in the military action. As a result people of East Pakistan became enemies of the Army. Last Governor of the East Pakistan, Dr. M.M. Malik, advised President General Yahya Khan to solve the matter through political means, but his proposals were not taken into account.
# 6. ROLE OF INDIA AND SUPER POWERS 

Taking advantage of the internal political situation of Pakistan, the then super powers (Soviet Union and America) used to interfere in East Pakistan through different means. India not only imparted military training to the escaped refugees from East Pakistan but also provided them weapons. Later on, American government declared that 7th American Marine Craft in Indian ocean is coming to save West Pakistan instead of East Pakistan. Thus the process of separation of East Pakistan was secretly supported by America. During the 2nd Islamic Summit Conference held in Lahore in February, 1974, Pakistan properly accepted Bangladesh (The Former East Pakistan).

## 7. NEGATIVE ROLE OF HINDU TEACHERS

After establishment of Pakistan, unfortunately, Bangali Muslims had always been backward in education than Hindus. The Hindu teachers were in majority in schools and colleges. They prepared the minds of new generations to rebel against the ideology of Pakistan. It paved the way for getting separation from West Pakistan.
